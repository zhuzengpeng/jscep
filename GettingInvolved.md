## File an Issue ##

Reporting bugs, requesting features or providing general feedback.

## Write a Test ##

Especially if you have access to a SCEP-capable server.  It would be good to provide a simple tool to allow adopters to test out **jscep** against their particular server.

## Submit a Patch ##

If you've come across a problem, or can improve an area of **jscep**, please provide a patch (using `svn diff`) on the latest version of the branch you're interested in (including trunk).

## Become a Committer ##

If you'd like to become more involved in **jscep**, then you can apply to become a committer, and fix reported issues and implement requested features.

## Coding Standards ##
