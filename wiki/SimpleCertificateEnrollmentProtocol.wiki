#summary About SCEP

== About ==

The Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol is a PKI communication protocol which leverages existing technology by using [http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2129 PKCS#7] and [http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2132 PKCS#10] over HTTP.  SCEP is the evolution of the enrollment protocol developed by !VeriSign, Inc. for Cisco Systems, Inc.

=== Actors ===

  # Requester or Client
  # CA

=== Steps ===

  # Requester sends *GetCACert* message to SCEP URL
  # Either CA or RA responds with single DER-encoded X.509 certificate DER-encoded 'degenerate' PKCS#7 !SignedData message with an X.509 certificate chain (CA -> RA)
  # Requester checks if CA certificate is trusted by prompting user with message digest of X.509 certificate
  # Requester constructs a PKCS#10 certificate signing request (CSR)
  # Requester constructs a PKCS#7 !EnvelopedData object using the DER-encoded CSR and encrypts the envelope encryption key (DES or Triple-DES) using the message recipient's public key (either the CA, or an RA with a keyEncipherment !KeyUsage extension)   
  # Requester constructs a PKCS#7 !SignedData using the DER-encoded !EnvelopedData and its certificate, and signs a MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512 digest of the data using its RSA private key
  # Requester sends the DER-encoded !SignedData object in a *PKCSReq* message to the RA (or CA)
  # RA (or CA) opens the !SignedData message and extracts the !EnvelopedData.
  # RA uses its private key to decrypt the !EnvelopedData and extracts the PKCS#10 CSR
  # RA examines the challengePassword in CSR to authenticate request
  # RA sends CSR to CA
  # CA generates X.509 certificate from CSR and signs it
  # CA sends signed-certificate to RA
  # RA creates a 'degenerate' !SignedData and adds signed-certificate
  # RA creates a !EnvelopedData with the DER-encoded !SignedData, encrypting using the Requesters public key (provided in the !SignedData)
  # RA creates a !SignedData object and signs using the RA key with a digitalSignature !KeyUsage extension
  # RA sends the message to the Requester
