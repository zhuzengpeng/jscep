You can build from source by downloading the source packages, or by checking out the latest source from SVN.

== Source Packages ==

Source packages are available from the Google Code [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/downloads/list?q=*sources.jar Downloads] page.  This is arguably the harder than building from SVN, as you will also need to download all of *jscep*'s dependencies.

== Building from SVN ==

=== Prerequisites ===

To build *jscep* from source, you'll need the following tools:

 * [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion]
 * [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven]

=== Checking Out ===

You can checkout the trunk by running the following commands on your command-line:

{{{
user@host:~$ svn checkout http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jscep-read-only
user@host:~$ cd jscep-read-only
user@host:~/jscep-read-only$ mvn install
}}}

This will check out the latest sources from the *jscep* SVN repository and build and install each of the project artefacts into your local Maven repository.

== Browsing the Source ==

If you'd like to view the source code without downloading a source package or using SVN, you can do so by [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/source/browse/ browsing the repository] using the Google Code viewer, or by using the subversion [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/ web interface].
