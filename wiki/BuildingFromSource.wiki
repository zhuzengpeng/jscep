You can use jSCEP by compiling the source, or by downloading one of the [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/downloads/list pre-compiled JARs].

== Source Packages ==

Source packages are available from the Google Code [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/downloads/list?q=*sources.jar Downloads] page.

== Building from Source ==

=== Prerequisites ===

To build *jscep* from source, you'll need the following tools:

 * [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion]
 * [http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven]

=== Getting the Source Code ===

You can checkout the trunk (what about other branches and tags?) by running the following commands on your command-line:

{{{
user@host:~$ svn checkout http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jscep-read-only
user@host:~$ cd jscep-read-only
user@host:~/jscep-read-only$ mvn install
}}}

This will check out the source code from the jSCEP subversion repository, followed by building each of the project artefacts and installing them into your local Maven repository.

== Browsing the Source ==

If you'd like to view the source code without downloading a source package or using subversion, you can do so by [http://code.google.com/p/jscep/source/browse/ browsing the repository] using the Google Code viewer, or by using the subversion [http://jscep.googlecode.com/svn/ web interface].
